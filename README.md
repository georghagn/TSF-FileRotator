# TFS-FileRotator
A robust, process-independent file rotator for Pharo Smalltalk. It monitors files (e.g., logs), rotates them based on configurable policies (size, age), and archives them..  It was specifically designed for heterogeneous environments (e.g. Go-Logger &amp; Pharo-Rotator) and uses file-based locks to reliably avoid conflicts..
